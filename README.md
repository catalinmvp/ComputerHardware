# ComputerHardware - Machine Learning mini project

Project link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Computer+Hardware

For this project, given a set of data containing comuter hardaware we will train a machine to give the best results. Some categories(columns) may provide unbalance data which will not be useful for our machine which will determine us to drop the column. At the end we will train our machine and use Linear Regression and Ridge Regression for proper results.
